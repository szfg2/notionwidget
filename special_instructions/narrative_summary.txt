Summarize the patient's clinical condition into a single narrative paragraph.

Guidelines:
- Focus on the main diagnosis, key background comorbidities, reason for hospital admission, significant investigations, current treatment, and clinical status.
- Write in a formal but concise style.
- Avoid listing in point form.
- If certain information is missing, do not invent it; leave it out.
- If lab results or imaging findings are important, integrate them naturally into the paragraph without listing values.

Example of ideal output:
"Mr Tan is a 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease who was admitted with shortness of breath secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. His course has been complicated by acute kidney injury requiring temporary dialysis. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral lower lobe consolidation, and he is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics with gradual clinical improvement. He remains hemodynamically stable on minimal oxygen support."

Return only the narrative paragraph without headings.
